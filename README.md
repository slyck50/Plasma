# Plasma
This will serve as the repository for all files related to CNC plasma cutting.
This includes calibration and testing g-code, along with specific part/project files.
All g-code is designed for use with Mach3.
My current setup is the Langmuir Crossfire XL CNC table with a Primeweld CUT60D plasma cutter.
