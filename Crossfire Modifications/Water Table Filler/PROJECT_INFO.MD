I wanted a low-profile way to fill the water table with my pump system without having to cut through the side of the tank.
This filler nozzle is designed to clip over the edge of the stainless steel version of the water table, and be easy to remove if necessary.
I placed it at the back left corner of mine, since it will almost never be in the way at this location.

There are two STL versions included: one is full-size and terminates at the inside bottom of the water table, and the other is a shorter version to prevent any kind of reverse siphoning.

The hose barb is sized for tubing with 5/8" ID.

This was printed in nylon on an SLS 3D printer, but most printers should be able to print this on its side without internal supports.
I've included the Fusion 360 file as well in case you want to modify it for your specific application.
