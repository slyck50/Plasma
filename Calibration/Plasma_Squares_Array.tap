(This g-code is designed to test different cutting settings by cutting an array of squares. Kerf width is compensated for so the squares can be checked for size accuracy too.)
(Change the values of #100 through #109 below to customize the test.)
(Created by Ryan Luecke for compatibility with Mach3.)

#100 = 1 (size of each test square to cut, in inches)
#101 = 0.055 (kerf width to compensate for, in inches)
#102 = 50 (minimum feed rate to test, IPM)
#103 = 100 (maximum feed rate to test, IPM)
#104 = 5 (number of squares to cut in X-axis direction)
#105 = 2 (number of squares to cut in Y-axis direction)
#106 = 0.25 (spacing between squares, in inches)
#107 = 0.25 (width of outer border to leave, in inches; set to 0 for no cut-out)
#108 = 500 (pierce delay, in milliseconds)
#109 = -1 (delay in milliseconds before moving to next square, set to -1 to Pause instead--give material time to cool or time to change PSI/amp settings)
#110 = [[#103 - #102] / [#104 * #105 - 1]] (calculated feed rate increment)
#111 = [#107 + #100 / 2 - 0.1] (starting Y-axis lead-in position)
#112 = [#107 + #100 - 0.2 - #101 / 2] (calculated X-axis starting position)
#113 = 0 (starting square in X-axis)
