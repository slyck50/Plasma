(This g-code is designed to test different cutting settings by cutting a series of profiles that include straight lines, curves, and right angles.)
(Change the values of #100, #101, #102, #104, #106, #107, and #108 below for a customized test.)
(Created by Ryan Luecke for compatibility with Mach3.)

#100 = 30 (minimum feed rate to test, IPM; set equal to max to use same feed rate the whole test)
#101 = 60 (maximum feed rate to test, IPM)
#102 = 7 (number of test profiles to cut)
#103 = [[#101 - #100] / [#102 - 1]] (calculated feed rate increment)
#104 = 3 (overall width of test profile in inches; if a border is desired, it will be added to this width)
#105 = [0.1 * #104] (Y-axis incremental step-over; calculated to leave room between each profile; 0.1 default; can be set manually if looser spacing is desired)
#106 = 0.25 (width of outside border to leave in inches; set to 0 for no cut-out and to leave plasma head at the set increment away from last cut, ready to run program again)
#107 = 500 (pierce delay in milliseconds)
#108 = 2000 (delay in milliseconds before moving to next square, set to -1 to Pause instead--gives material time to cool, or time to change psi/amp settings)
